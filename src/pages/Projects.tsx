                        is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns
                        marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing
                        three of their marks in a diagonal, horizontal, or vertical row is
                        the winner. It is a solved game with a forced draw assuming best
                        play from both players.
